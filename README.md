npm install

In order to run barcode scanner required:

$ ionic plugin add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner

even though they were installed earlier

for Google native maps

$ ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-googlemaps --variable API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID="YOUR_ANDROID_API_KEY_IS_HERE" --variable

$ npm install --save @ionic-native/google-maps
